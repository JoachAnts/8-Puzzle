# 8-Puzzle

This is a Java implementation of the 8-puzzle that uses the A* search algorithm to find the fastest solution,
and then passes the moves list to the GUI which renders them. The code could do with a bit of cleaning up, which I might get around
to at some point. I copied and pasted the GUI component from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jmhertlein/9514d5729fe7be9cbe79), as I
wanted to focus on the algorithmic component of the puzzle.
